My name is Tony Gregg. I'm an entrepreneur, software engineer and enterprise architect. I'm originally from Barcelona, Spain, but I moved to Florida in 2010.
I love all foods, particularly Spanish food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
I love playing Tennis during my free time.
